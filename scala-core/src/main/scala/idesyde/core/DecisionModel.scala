/** The trait/interface for a decision model in the design space identification methodology, as
  * defined in [1].
  *
  * A decision model holds information on how to build a design space that is explorable. In other
  * words, an object that implements this trait is assumed to provide parameters, and/or decision
  * variables, and/or analysis techniques for a certain design model. The trait itself is the bare
  * minimum so that the identification procedure can be performed to completion properly.

    * covering, or if there a full overlap at all. This method is also heavily relied upon during
    * the idenfitication procedure to state whether a fix-point has been reached or not.
    *
    * The default implementation checks whether the [[coveredElements]] and the
    * [[coveredElementRelations]] are a subset between the two [[DecisionModel]] s. This is already
    * good enough for many cases, specially for when then two [[DecisionModel]] s being compared are
    * of different classes, i.e. are actual different [[DecisionModel]] s in terms of parameters.
    *
    * However, there are a couple cases when _additional_ checks can be done to have a finer-grained
    * notion of dominance (emphasis on **additional**): when comparing two [[DecisionModel]] objects
    * of the same type. In this case, it might be possible that one [[DecisionModel]] contains more
    * information than the other, even though their coverage could be possibly the same. Once more,
    * a very well-designed [[DecisionModel]] should _not_ require special treatment for dominance,
    * since all the dominance aspects are ideally computed by subset comparisons. But life has to be
    * taken realistically, and thus the option exists.
    *
    * Thus, the gold rule-of-thumb here is: if you need to override the default implementation, that
    * is okay as long as you think long and hard how could the same dominance comparisons be
    * achieved with just comparison between [[coveredElements]] and [[coveredElementRelations]].
