/** This trait is the root for all possible explorers within IDeSyDe. A real explorer should
 * implement this trait by dispatching the real exploration from 'explore'.
 *
 * The Design model is left a type parameter because the explorer might be used in a context where
 * explorers for different decision models and design models are used together. A correct
 * implemention of the explorer should then:
 *
 *   1. if the DesignModel is part of the possible design models covered, it should return a
 *      lazylist accodingly.
 *   2. If the DesignModel si not part of the possible design models, then
 *      the explorer should return an empty lazy list.
 *   3. If the decision model is unexplorable regardless, an empty list should be returned.
 *
 * See [1] for some extra information on how the explorer fits the design space identifcation
 * approach, as well as [[idesyde.exploration.api.ExplorationHandler]] to see how explorers used
 * together in a generic context.
