**Case information**
 - OS: [e.g. OSX 11, Debian GNU/Linux 9]
 - Version [e.g. IDeSyDe 0.7.8]

**Describe the bug and the expected outcome**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is and its context.

This goes for both developer-level bugs, e.g. "Identification rule number 5 of the Java module fails with my input `X`" and for user-level bugs, e.g. "My model file `X` does not have any partial identification working".
If you are reporting a user-level bug, kindly do your best to describe in good detail why IDeSyDe should succeed in performing DSE for your input files, e.g. "I see in the `examples` folder that there are `App4mc` files and I have a simple 'Independent periodic task' specification but IDeSyDe does not identify anything to explore in my file".

*Do not forget to attach the input files for your bug!*
