/** The trait/interface for an identification library that provides the identification and
  * integration rules required to power the design space identification process [1].
  *
  * [[identificationRules]] are functions that abstracts [[DesignModel]] s systematically to
  * [[DecisionModel]] s until it becomes a set of "solvable" parameters and functions.
  *
  * [[integrationRules]] are basically the inverse of [[identificationRules]]: They take solved
  * [[DecisionModels]] and "integrate" the solutions in the abstracted domain back to the design
  * domain, in the [[DesignModel]] s.
