    This function returns a precedence graph of sdf 'jobs' so that any
    scheduling algorithm can work upon then directly if it is a variant
    of job shop scheduling. The returned graph has the notions of _weak_
    and _strong_ precedences:

        - if j2 weak proceeds j1, j1 must start before j2 starts.
        - if j2 strong proceeds j2, j1 must finish before j2 starts.

    Arguments:
        actors: The SDF actors.
        channels: The Channel representations between every actor.
        topology: The SDF topology matrix: consumptions and productions.
        repetition_vector: The amount of firings for each actor in actors.
            It is expected that the repetition vector is a column vector.
        initial_tokens: the delays for each channel of the SDF graph.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing 1) the actors as jobs, 2) the weak procededences
        and the 3) strong procedences.
