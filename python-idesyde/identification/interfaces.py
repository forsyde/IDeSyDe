    Along with IdentificatioRules, DecisionModels is the most important interface
    for the identification activity within Design Space Exploration. It
    Characterizes 'subproblems' that are increasingly composoable and can
    stepwise be identified in the entry model which is assumed to be a ForSyDe IO
    model.

    Another important aspect of always implementing this interface
    (by subclassing it) is that it enables further pieces in the code
    to summon all DecisionModels, since they are all back-related to
    this interface. This strategy is used in the identification
    procedure to gather all available DecisionModel when a specific
    list is not given.
