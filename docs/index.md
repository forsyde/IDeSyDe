# IDeSyDe

Welcome to IDeSyDe's documentation page.
Here you can find some quick links to help you navigate the documentation
and also to situate you about the tool and its methods. 
<!-- Many segments of this documentation are derivations and improvements over the MEMOCODE'23 paper describing IDeSyDe (link in the future!). -->

 * [IDeSyDe for the end-user: demonstrators](usage)
 * [Design space identification and exploration](dsi_dse)
 * IDeSyDe for the experts: extensions

<!-- A quick glance at [Concepts](/concepts) can likely clarify this further! -->

<!-- Check @ref:[Guidelines](usage/guidelines.md)
to see how one would extends IDeSyDe or ForSyDe IO to support a design space different than those that exist. -->

<!-- 
## What can IDeSyDe do for me?

As a tool for Design Space Exploration, IDeSyDe can potentially give you design decisions on your models
such as mappings, schedules, allocations among others. 

These decisions are not random: they respect
design constraints such as memory, time or energy.

This also means that if you let IDeSyDe run long enough, and have just the right amount of computational resources,
it can can give back a solution "*Your design is not possible*".
It is always good to know designs are not possible before they crash! -->
