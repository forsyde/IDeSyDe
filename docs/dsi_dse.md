# Design space identification and exploration

Design space identification (DSI) is a __compositional and systematic__ approach for creating design space exploration (DSE) solutions for model-driven-engineering (MDE)
models in a generic and tuneable manner. [It was first proposed in this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9474082).
Tuneablity means the capability of __transparently__ using __efficient problem-specific__ DSE solutions whenever possible.
DSI consists of three consecutive stages (grey boxes in the FigureÂ below) and is intuitively understood as follows:

1. __Identification stage__: This stage represents the systematic
    production of DSE models such as the synchronous dataflow (SDF) DSE solution of
    [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3133210) from
    MDE inputs such as [SDF3](https://www.es.ele.tue.nl/sdf3/) application and platform description files.
    No exploration is done at this stage.

2. __Bidding and exploration stage__: This stage represents the systematic choice of the best combination of explorers (solution  algorithms)
    and identified DSE models for the input MDE models.
    In other words, the choice between different design space abstractions and the solution algorithm that explores these design spaces.
    The chosen explorer then explores the associated chosen DSE model to enrich this DSE model with the DSE results,
    e.g. adding actor-to-tile mappings in the SDF DSE solution mentioned.

3. __Reverse identification stage__:
    This stage represents the systematic production of MDE models from the DSE solutions of the bidding and exploration stage.
    The systematic production includes both textual and graphical MDE models.

Executing the three stages consecutively is called a __flow run__.
The three explicit stages contrast to [the first proposal](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9474082),
where the second and third stages are intertwined. Such enhancement is
more convenient for implementation purposes because as the explicit interfaces
between identification, exploration and reverse identification can be
implemented in general-purpose programming languages.

From now on, we simply write DSI to refer to the enhanced version.
We describe the different DSI elements (also shown in the Figure above) in the following sections;
we also discuss composability and aspects of correctness.

## Design models and decision models {#sec:dec-des-models}

A __design model__ is a model used by MDE frameworks and tools, e.g. Simulink and [ForSyde IO](https://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-io/).
A __decision model__ is a collection of parameters and associated functions that
potentially define design spaces, e.g. a decision model for SDFs with a topology
matrix parameter and an associated function to check the existence of deadlocks.

The definitions for decision and design models are intentionally __open__.
This openness ensures the generality and domain independence of
DSI implementations such as IDeSyDe.
However, every design model $$M$$ and decision model $$X$$
must provide a set of partially identified elements $$\mathit{part}(X)$$
and a set of partially identifiable elements $$\mathit{elems}(M)$$,
respectively. Mathematically, $$\mathit{part}(X)$$ and $$\mathit{elems}(M)$$
can take elements from any set as long as they are the same, i.e
$$\mathit{part}(X) \subset \mathbb{U} \leftrightarrow \mathit{elems}(M) \subset \mathbb{U}$$;
in practice, $$\mathbb{U}$$ can be the set of strings $$\mathbb{S}$$ without
loss of generality, since MDE components can be string encoded. For the
sake of computational efficiency, __unique identifiers__ can be used
instead of encoding the entire component's data; the component data can
later be shared without jeopardising the identification procedure.
IDeSyDe follows this approach.

We use $$\mathit{part}(\mathcal{X})$$ and $$\mathit{elems}(\mathcal{M})$$ as
shorthand for the union of the contained $$\mathit{part}(X)$$ or
$$\mathit{elems}(M)$$; that is,
$$\mathit{part}(\mathcal{X}) = \cup_{X \in \mathcal{X}}\mathit{part}(X)$$
and
$$\mathit{elems}(\mathcal{M})=\cup_{M \in \mathcal{M}}\mathit{elems}(M)$$.

## Identification and reverse identification rules {#sec:ident-rever-rules}

An identification rule $$r$$ is a function from the input design models
set $$\mathcal{M}$$ and any set of decision models $$\mathcal{X}_i$$ to a
new set of decision models $$\mathcal{X}_{r,i+1}$$:

$$\mathcal{X}_{r,i+1} = r(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{X}_{i})$$
  
as long as $$r$$ is __monotonically increasing__ concerning the number of the __partially identified__ elements
of $$\mathcal{M}$$; that is:

$$\mathit{part}(\mathcal{X}_{r,i}) \subseteq \mathit{part}(\mathcal{X}_{r,i+1}) \subseteq \mathit{elems}(\mathcal{M})$$

Intuitively, the last equation requires that if the partially identified
part of the input models does not change, the identified decision model
remains the same.
In other words, an identification rule at step $$i+1$$
cannot partially identify __less__ elements than it did at step $$i$$ the recurrence equation.
Checking that a function $$r$$ satisfies monotonicity automatically is difficult as it ultimately
requires checking if $$r$$'s implementation never violates the condition
for __any__ input.
An alternative to ensure $$r$$ is monotonic is to define a set of
identification rule function templates that are monotonic by construction.
This is yet to be researched and developed.

A reverse identification rule $$\rho$$ is a function from the input design
models set $$\mathcal{M}$$ and the set of explored decision models
$$\mathcal{Y}$$ to a new set of explored design models $$\mathcal{M}_{\rho}'$$:

$$\mathcal{M}_{\rho}' = \rho(\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{M})$$

Unlike identification rules, reverse identification rules have no
requirements relating its inputs and outputs. This considerably reduces
the initial effort for implementing a new $$\rho$$ when the input and
output MDE frameworks are different.
An example case is taking Simulink models as input design model and producing ForSyDe IO design models as output.
In these cases, a requirement such as monotonicity potentially requires $$\rho$$ to be a
complete model-to-model transformation.

## Explorers {#sec:explorers}

An explorer $E$ is a collection of decision and optimisation methods
that explore the design space of decision models. These methods range
from generic decision and optimisation frameworks such as
[constraint programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming) to
problem-specific heuristics. Consequently, an explorer can be incapable
of solving a decision model if the decision model is not compatible with
the explorer's method.

This is represented with a function $$\mathit{able}_E(X)$$ for every $$E$$
which is true if $$E$$ can explore $$X$$ and false otherwise. Additionally,
a function $$\mathit{explore}_E(X)$$ exists for every $$E$$ that returns a
set of explored decision models $$\mathcal{Y}$$. The reason both
$$\mathit{explore}_E(X)$$ and $$\mathit{able}_E(X)$$ exists is to
distinguish when $$\mathcal{Y}$$ is empty because no solution exists, and
when $$\mathcal{Y}$$ is empty because $$E$$ cannot explore $$X$$.

Different explorers may display different __exploration properties for the same decision model__.
For example, one explorer is the most accurate but also the slowest for a decision model.
Note that exploration properties are not the same as performance metrics but characteristics
of the exploration method itself. We remark that exploration properties can be __estimates__.
For example, the exploration property "average time to find a first feasible solution" for the SDF CP solution mentioned could be estimated as
an expression on the size of actor and channels of the input
SDF applications.

These properties are represented through __biddings__. The bidding of $$E$$
for a decision model $$X$$, $$\mathit{bid}_E(X)$$, is a set of pairs in
$$\mathbb{S} \times \mathbb{R}$$ with non-negative real entries. Biddings
define a __dominance__ relation that can be exploited to automate the
choice of the best biddings. For every two distinct $$(E, X)$$ and
$$(E', X')$$ where $$\mathit{able}_E(X)$$ and $$\mathit{able}_{E'}(X')$$ are
both true, we say that $$(E, X)$$ __dominates__ $$(E', X')$$ if either:

1. $$\mathit{part}(X') \subset \mathit{part}(X)$$; or,

2. $$\mathit{part}(X') = \mathit{part}(X)$$ but $$\mathit{bid}_E(X)$$ and
    $$\mathit{bid}_{E'}(X')$$ have equal entries string-wise but the
    former is smaller number-wise.

The first condition ensures dominance when $$X$$ partially identifies more
elements than $$X'$$ in accordance with the DSI approach; the second condition ensures
dominance for the explorer $$E$$ when it is a better explorer for
comparable decision models.

## First stage: identification procedure {#sec:ident-proc}

In the first stage, a set of decision models $$\mathcal{X}$$ is identified
from the input design models set $$\mathcal{M}$$ given a set of
identification rules $$R_{\mathit{ident}}$$. This identification is
performed stepwise through the identification procedure recurrence
relation:

$$\mathcal{X}_{i+1} = \mathcal{X}_{i} \bigcup_{r \in R_{\mathit{ident}}} r(\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{X}_i)$$

The identification procedure is performed until a fix-point
$$\mathcal{X}$$ is reached; that is, $$\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{X}_{i+1}$$
when $$\mathit{part}(\mathcal{X}_{i+1}) = \mathit{part}(\mathcal{X}_{i})$$, as
outlined by the recurrence equation presented previously.
This fix-point exists due to the monotonicity requirement, and the resulting identified decision
model set $$\mathcal{X}$$ is used in the next stage.

Note that the initial set $$\mathcal{X}_0$$ is not specified. This is
because the recurrence equation is __incremental__;
the first execution for a $$\mathcal{M}$$ starts with $$\mathcal{X}_0 = \emptyset$$, but
the equation can be repeated with the resulting
$$\mathcal{X}$$, or any intermediate $$\mathcal{X}_i$$, to achieve the same
$$\mathcal{X}$$ fix-point for $$\mathcal{M}$$.

An identification rule returns a set of identified decision
models instead of a single decision model as defined in [the first proposal](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9474082).
 However, these two definitions are conceptually equivalent since identification rules in
[the first proposal](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9474082) also progressively "partially
identify more elements of $$\mathcal{M}$$ by taking previously partially
identified $$X \in \mathcal{X}$$".

## Second stage: bidding procedure and exploration {#sec:dse-proc}

In the second stage, a set of explorers $$\mathcal{E}$$ bid for the
identified decision models and the winning bid proceeds to exploration.
The bidding procedure may result in multiple biddings do not dominate
each other; if there is more than one bidding, they
cannot be compared by construction, and one is randomly chosen.

Mathematically, the set $$\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{X}$$ of dominating bids
is computed via the dominance relation by keeping only the dominant bids:

$$
  \mathcal{B} =
  \left\{
  \begin{gathered}
    (E, X) \\ \in \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{X}
  \end{gathered}
  \middle\vert
  \begin{aligned}
    \nexists & (E', X')\in \mathcal{E} \times \mathcal{X} \setminus \{(E, X)\}, \\ &(E, X) \text{ dominates } (E', X')
  \end{aligned}
  \right\}$$
  
then, a bid $$(E, X) \in \mathcal{B}$$ is chosen and so that
$$\mathit{explore}_E(X)$$ returns a set $$\mathcal{Y}$$ of explored decision
models for the last stage.

## Third stage: reverse identification procedure {#sec:reverse-ident-proc}

Despite their conceptual analogy, the reverse identification procedure
is simpler than the identification procedure. This is because the input
explored decision models $$\mathcal{Y}$$ are already dominant, which
entails that all the elements required to obtain the explored design
model are already present in $$\mathcal{Y}$$. Thus, one identification
step is enough and a fix-point-based procedure like the identification one is unnecessary.
The final explored design model set $$\mathcal{M}'$$ is given by the union of the results of the
given set of reverse identification rules $$R_{\mathit{rev}}$$:

$$\mathcal{M}' = \bigcup_{\rho \in R_{\mathit{rev}}} \rho(\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{M})$$

We choose the word "reverse" instead of "inverse" as reverse
identification rules are __not__ inverse mathematical functions of
identification rules. By bidding, we mean the process where different
explorers share exploration characteristics and compete to explore a
decision model.

## Composability and correctness aspects {#sec:composability}

The DSI composability is centred around identification rules, explorers and
reverse identification rules.
Extending a DSI-based DSE tool, such as IDeSyDe, is equivalent to
adding a new identification rule, explorer, or reverse identification
rule. This is possible because the definitions presented here do __not require explicit dependencies__
between themselves or across different stages, nor do they require
explicit dependencies on a subset of design or decision models. Due to
this loosely-coupled nature, the backwards compatibility of tools like
IDeSyDe is systematically guaranteed if extensions are strictly
additive.

Since the decision and design model definitions are open,
correctness is only well-defined on a
model-by-model basis. However, as a composable approach, the
conservation of correctness can be discussed and analysed.

Concretely, every decision model has _invariants_ that are always valid,
e.g. for SDF
decision models, actors only connect through channels, not directly. In
this sense, a correct identification rule always produces decision
models satisfying their invariants. Design models and reverse
identification rules can be discussed analogously as
MDE frameworks
typically have their invariants and assumptions. Because explorers are a
collection of methods, they are correct if such methods are sound and
complete.

Automatically verifying these notions of correctness is difficult; for
the same reasons verifying monotonicity cannot be easily verified automatically.
However, verification can be
avoided by defining decision and design models so that their invariants
are valid by construction. For example, a decision model for tiled-based
multicore hardware without parameters or associated functions for
shared-memory elements avoids checking if the model contains
shared-memory elements. Currently, IDeSyDe follows this
correct-by-construction approach as much as possible and provides
documentation when invariants must be enforced via (reverse)
identification rules.
