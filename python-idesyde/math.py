def integralize_vector(vec: sympy.Matrix) -> sympy.Matrix:
    '''Scale vector to have all elements as integers

    Arguments:
        vec: It is expected to be a sympy Matrix, but maybe
        other bi-iterable objects can work as well, as long
        as sympy can compute the GCD of the input values.

    Returns:
        Integralized vector. Note that this works solely on the
        input vector and therefore no mathematical properties
        are guaranteed except that a common factor is applied
        to all the vector's entries.
